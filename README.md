## Hispar List
Hispar list is a research-oriented list of web pages that can be used for
Internet measurements. It is the _first_ top list to provide URLs, not just
domain names.

### Download
We prepare weekly lists of Top 100K and Top 1M URLs.

### Methodology
We use the Tranco list to obtain the list of top one million domains. Then we
query Bing/Google to get search results for these domains. Top 100K lists
*50* URLs each for *2000* domains, while Top 1M lists *100* URLs each for
*10000* domains. In case a domain does not have enough URLs in its search
results, domains below *10000* are used to complete 100K/1M URLs. 

### Dependencies
To install the dependencies, simply run `sudo make install`.

### Credentials
You will need to obtain search credentials from here if you want to use Bing,
and from here if you want to use Google.
